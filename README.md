# robotics-localisation
I built this project for my 1st year course of Robot programming at the University of Birmingham. I was part of a team of 10 where my task was to program a LEGO robot to find its location when it is randomly set on a 10x10m big area. The project works using the java library legos which converts java code to a LEGO robot readable one.
